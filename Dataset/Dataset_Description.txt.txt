Dataset Description

This file describes the dataset associated with the following publication:

Kallioras S., Graziotti F., Magenes G.
"Vertical accelerations in seismic analysis: A numerical investigation of their effects on URM structures."
Earthquake Spectra, 2025. DOI: pending.

------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains processed numerical data from the nonlinear time-history analyses (NLTHA) of the case-study unreinforced masonry (URM) building, subjected to:
- horizontal ground motion components only, and
- combined horizontal and vertical components.

Eight data files are provided in .mat format, each corresponding to one of the analysis sets defined in Table 2 of the paper:

  - Set-A-1.mat
  - Set-A-2.mat
  - Set-B-1.mat
  - Set-B-2.mat
  - Set-C-1.mat
  - Set-C-2.mat
  - Set-C-3.mat
  - Set-C-4.mat

Each file includes:

1. Two data matrices containing the maximum displacement demands:
   - One for slender pier walls (i.e., "Windows" wall)
   - One for squat pier walls (i.e., "Doors" wall)
   Displacements are expressed in millimetres (mm).
   NaN values indicate collapse, either due to crashing of the numerical procedure or when the drift ratio demand exceeds 4%, as defined in the paper.
   Matrix columns:
     - Column 1: Demand under H1 only
     - Column 2: Demand under H2 only
     - Column 3: Demand under combined H1 + V
     - Column 4: Demand under combined H2 + V

2. A matrix of ground motion record IDs (83 rows Ã— 4 columns), listing the applied records for each analysis case.
   The row order matches that of the displacement demand matrices.
